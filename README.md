# BigAssNum

This is a group project by Liam Goss, Eric Rivera, and Luigi Santiago-Villa designed to implement arithmetic operations on numbers larger than the max size of C++ built-in datatypes. 

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction (WIP)
- Multiplication
- Division (WIP)
- Modulo (MIP)


## Roadmap

- Upon successful implementation of all operations, optimization is the next step

- After an optimized solution is formed, this can be converted into a library for use in other projects
